    <p> Our Early Years Foundation Stage Unit offers a wide variety of experiences and opportunities for our children to develop the key characteristics of effective teaching and learning:<br></p>

<p>playing and exploring - children investigate and experience things, and ‘have a go’
active learning - children concentrate and keep on trying if they encounter difficulties, and enjoy achievements
creating and thinking critically - children have and develop their own ideas, make links between ideas, and develop strategies for doing things.
Our children’s personal, social and emotional development is vital to ensuring resilient motivated learners. Our dedicated team of EYFS staff ensure their needs are met every day. Child initiated learning is a fundamental part of our practice in EYFS enabling our children to develop quickly into increasingly independent learners.<br></p>

<p>At Key Stage 1 a high emphasis is placed on ensuring our children have a firm grounding in the basics: phonics, reading, writing, arithmetic and problem solving. We follow the Letters and Sounds phonic programme. Our children achieve well in the Year 1 Phonics Screening Check and KS1 SATs in Year 2.<br></p>

<p>In Key Stage 2 we focus on developing a range of transferable skills, challenging our children to work at greater depth and mastery within each year group’s age related expectations. One of our aims is to prepare the children to thrive within a fast changing technological and globalised world.<br></p>

<p>Our curriculum is stimulating, creative and challenging. We encourage our children to question everything, think critically, problem solve, reason and build upon their God-given talents each and every day.<br></p>

<p>The Arts are very important to us here at Arden – our children love to sing, dance and act! We ensure that every child in Years 4 to 6 will have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. Every child will have a string instrument to learn and play, and we host numerous concerts.<br></p>

<p>We place great emphasis on being a 'physically active school' and as such we host sporting activities throughout the year. We advocate the daily mile.<br></p>
